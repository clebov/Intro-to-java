Assignment: Total Sales

(TOTAL SALES) Use a two-dimensional array to solve the following problem: A company has four salespeople (1 to 4) who sell five different products (1 to 5).
Once a day, each salesperson passes in a slip for each type of product sold. Each slip contains the following:
    1. The salesperson number
    2. The product number
    3. The total dollar value of that product sold that day
Thus, each salesperson passes in between 0 and 5 sales slips per day.


Assume that the information from all the slips for last month is available.
Write an application that will read all this information for last monthâ€™s sales and summarize the total sales by salesperson and by product.
All totals should be stored in the two-dimensional array sales.
After processing all the information for last month, display the results in tabular format, with each column representing a salesperson and each row representing a particular product.
Cross-total each row to get the total sales of each product for last month.
Cross-total each column to get the total sales by salesperson for last month.
Your output should include these cross-totals to the right of the totaled rows and to the bottom of the totaled columns
