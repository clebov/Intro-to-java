/*
(RECTANGLE CLASS) 
Create a class Rectangle with attributes length and width, each of which defaults to 1. 
Provide methods that calculate the rectangleâ€™s perimeter and area. It has set and get methods for both length and width. 
The set methods should verify that length and width are each floating-point numbers larger than 0.0 and less than 20.0. 
Write a program to test class Rectangle.
